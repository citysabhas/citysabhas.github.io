## Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment 

### Philosophy
We, the Federation of City Sabhas, Chennai, have observed with a heavy heart the allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment within the classical arts and theatre community in Chennai, India. 
As a group that wants to further the cause of classical arts and increase its reach in the country, we acknowledge that the fear of sexual harassment is a great deterrent to the learning, appreciation and performance of these art forms.
We understand that the art field that we are a part of is a diverse and complex one, and there is an intertwining of various kinds of hierarchical and non-hierarchical relationships and different power structures at play. 
An artist’s life extends from performances to personal classes, and sometimes beyond that as well. It is therefore essential that every person who is a part of this intricate structure understands and realizes the gravity of the responsibility in ensuring the integrity and holistic development of the art and the impact of sexual harassment allegations on the purity of the relationships in this forum, and also the zero-tolerance to sexual harassment that the Federation of City Sabhas has towards any individual who commits or resorts to any form of sexual harassment. 
We are committed to provide a safe space free of any kind of abuse or sexual harassment to artists – in their capacity as performers, students and teachers, rasikas, representatives from the media and any other person who has a grievance against an individual(s) involved with the Federation of City Sabhas.  
In furtherance of our commitment, a prevention of sexual harassment policy  (“Policy”) has been adopted by the Federation of City Sabhas to put in place a mechanism for redress of grievances that are along the lines of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (also referred to as the “Prevention of Sexual Harassment Act”). Keeping in mind the complexities that might arise in dealing with complaints of harassment in this context, the aim of this policy is to enable complaints that go beyond the strict confines of the 2013 Act and provide for a grievance redressal mechanism that is faithful to the principles of natural justice.
This gender neutral Policy goes beyond the statutory definition of “workplace” to cover acts of harassment that may occur even outside Sabha venues, as the art fraternity has a large interaction radius and sphere of influence and an extended environment that goes beyond Sabha venues and performance places. 
The Federation acknowledges with gratitude the contributions of Ms. B. Poongkhulali, who provided the first draft of the Policy and Ms. Uma Ramanathan, Ms. Sudha Raghunathan, Ms. Usha Dinesh, Dr. R. Thara and Dr. B.Vivekanand who have provided their inputs in drafting this Policy. There are also several other artists who have given valuable suggestions in framing this Policy and the Federation thanks them all for sharing their concerns and providing suggestions.
This Policy is the first of its kind and we foresee that it will evolve according to the needs of, and inputs from the art fraternity and the people associated with it. The Policy is only a broad framework which will guide the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in the process of its inquiry into complaints and the ICC is free to make any modifications and/or additions to the rules of procedure while dealing with each complaint, based on the needs, facts and circumstances of the particular complaint, after due notice to the parties involved in the complaint. The Policy should be read in harmony with individual Sabha policies, if any. The same is outlined in detail below:
